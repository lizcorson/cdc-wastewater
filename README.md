# CDC Wastewater Data Visualizations

This app creates understandable plots of the [CDC's COVID wastewater data](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/NWSS-Public-SARS-CoV-2-Wastewater-Metric-Data/2ew6-ywp6) so that people can assess their community risk levels in order to protect themselves. The app is currently available [here](https://cdc-covid-wastewater.herokuapp.com/).
## Why?

Levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are a leading indicator of COVID cases in the community and don't require people to get PCR tested on an individual level.

The [CDC's display of wastewater data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance) is incomprehensible to the average person. I'm trying to make it easier to understand.

## Who are you, anyway?

I'm a software engineer with a background in chemical engineering and biology.
