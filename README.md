# CDC Wastewater Data Visualizations

This app creates understandable plots of the CDC's COVID wastewater data so that people can assess their community risk levels in order to protect themselves.
## Why?

Levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are a leading indicator of COVID cases in the community and don't require people to get PCR tested on an individual level.

The CDC's display of this data is incomprehensible to the average person. I'm trying to make it easier to understand.

## Who are you, anyway?

I'm a software engineer with a background in chemical engineering and biology.
